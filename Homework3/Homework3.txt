As instructed in class, for homework 3, let's build on homework 2.
For this homework, repeat homework 2, but display the data in a GridView of four columns.
The view must occupy the entire width of the screen (minus edge paddings or margins).
Style each grid to your satisfaction.

PS: I'd encourage you to begin practicing how to style views and layouts.
This is an important UI development aspect.
For this homework:
	use background colors in each cell, possibly random colors
	change the text color of the state TextView
		choose a color that looks good on the background color of it's cell

For inspiration, go to the Google Play Store and download the Google I/O 2014 app.
Browse through the app, click on all the menu items,
and see the use of bright colors on their ListViews and GridViews.
Also observe how the padding, and margins, and their use of white spaces.
Try to emulate in homework3.
